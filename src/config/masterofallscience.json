    "help": "This is an inline bot. This means that you can use it on any chat, private or group, without inviting it. Just type \"@MrPoopyBot <your search>\" and wait. The bot will show you some screenshots matching your query, and you can select one of them. Try it here! Just make sure to add \"@MrPoopyBot\" at the beginning of your message.\n\nYou can generate \"meme\" images by adding your own caption to the image. To do this, write your search query, and the text you want separated by a slash (/). For instance, \"@MrPoopyBot schwifty / get schwifty\" and then pick one of the thumbnails. The image will be generated with your text.\n\nYou can send gifs by adding \"gif\" as the first word of your query. After that use it as always, you can even add a caption for the gif. For instance \"@MrPoopyBot gif drugs lisa\""
